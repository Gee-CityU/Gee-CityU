- 👋 Hi, I’m Gee (an assistant professor in the Department of English at CityU HK). I established the repository on Github to share personal and external codes with scholars in applied linguistics and relevant areas. 
- 👀 I’m interested in corpus linguistics, English for acaedmic purposes, grammar/syntax, and natural language processing. 
- 🌱 I've been working on using corpus-based approaches to investigate grammatical complexity in academic writing with the support of computational techniques.
